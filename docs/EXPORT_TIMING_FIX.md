# Export Timing Fix - Critical Bugs Resolved

## Problem Summary

The exported video had three critical issues:
1. **Sped up playback** - Video played faster than real-time
2. **Inconsistent speed** - Sometimes jumped forward or skipped
3. **No audio reactivity** - Elements just rotated, not reacting to audio

## Root Causes Identified

### Bug #1: Incorrect Frame Seeking Math ❌

**Location:** `export-orchestrator.ts` lines 459-464

**The Problem:**
```typescript
const currentTime = settings.startTime + frameIndex / fps;  // e.g., 5.0
const currentFrame = Math.floor(currentTime * fps);          // e.g., 300!
playerRef.seekTo(currentFrame);  // Skips to frame 300 instead of 0!
```

When `startTime = 5` seconds and `fps = 60`:
- Frame 0: calculates `currentFrame = 300` (5 × 60)
- Frame 1: calculates `currentFrame = 301`
- This skipped the first 5 seconds worth of frames!

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// Just seek to the frame index directly - no offset calculation needed
playerRef.seekTo(frameIndex);
```

The `frameIndex` is already the correct 0-based frame number. The Remotion player handles time internally.

### Bug #2: Offline Audio Data Never Used ❌

**Location:** `export-orchestrator.ts` and `use-audio-frame-data.ts`

**The Problem:**
- We extracted perfect frame-by-frame audio data (FFT analysis)
- But **never injected it** into the rendering pipeline
- Components still read from the live `AnalyserNode`, which was playing at real-time speed
- This caused complete audio/visual desync

**The Fix:**

1. **Added offline audio storage to export store** (`export-store.ts`):
```typescript
export interface ExportAudioFrameData {
  frequencyData: Uint8Array;
  timeDomainData: Uint8Array;
  sampleRate: number;
  fftSize: number;
}

interface ExportStore {
  // ... other fields
  currentOfflineAudioData: ExportAudioFrameData | null;
  setCurrentOfflineAudioData: (data: ExportAudioFrameData | null) => void;
}
```

2. **Inject audio data for each frame** (`export-orchestrator.ts`):
```typescript
for (let frameIndex = 0; frameIndex < totalFrames; frameIndex++) {
  // Inject offline audio data for this frame
  const audioFrameData = offlineAudioData.frames[frameIndex];
  if (audioFrameData) {
    exportStore.setCurrentOfflineAudioData(audioFrameData);
  }
  
  // ... render and capture
}
```

3. **Use offline data during export** (`use-audio-frame-data.ts`):
```typescript
const getAudioFrameData = useCallback(() => {
  // Check if we're exporting and have offline audio data
  const exportStore = useExportStore.getState();
  const offlineAudioData = exportStore.currentOfflineAudioData;
  
  // If exporting, use offline data instead of analyzer
  if (exportStore.isExporting && offlineAudioData) {
    return {
      frequencyData: offlineAudioData.frequencyData,
      timeDomainData: offlineAudioData.timeDomainData,
      sampleRate: offlineAudioData.sampleRate,
      fftSize: offlineAudioData.fftSize,
    };
  }
  
  // Normal playback - use analyzer
  // ... existing code
});
```

### Bug #3: Single RAF Too Fast ❌

**Location:** `export-orchestrator.ts` line 467

**The Problem:**
```typescript
// Single RAF is enough - double RAF was overkill
await new Promise((resolve) => requestAnimationFrame(resolve));
```

One `requestAnimationFrame` doesn't give enough time for complex scenes to fully render before capture, especially with:
- Multiple layers
- Shader compilation
- Canvas compositing
- React re-renders

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// Use double RAF to ensure render completes
await new Promise((resolve) => requestAnimationFrame(resolve));
await new Promise((resolve) => requestAnimationFrame(resolve));
```

This gives the browser two frames to complete all rendering operations before we capture.

## Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/stores/export-store.ts`**
   - Added `ExportAudioFrameData` interface
   - Added `currentOfflineAudioData` state
   - Added `setCurrentOfflineAudioData` action

2. **`src/lib/utils/export-orchestrator.ts`**
   - Fixed frame seeking: removed time offset calculation
   - Inject offline audio data for each frame
   - Restored double RAF for proper render completion

3. **`src/lib/hooks/use-audio-frame-data.ts`**
   - Check for export mode and offline audio data
   - Return offline data during export instead of live analyzer data

---

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

✅ **Correct playback speed** - Video plays at exactly the target FPS  
✅ **Consistent timing** - No jumps or speed variations  
✅ **Perfect audio sync** - Elements react to audio frame-accurately  
✅ **Smooth motion** - Double RAF ensures complete renders  

---

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. Load an audio file
2. Create a simple visualizer (e.g., Particle System or Orbiting Cubes)
3. Export a 10-second video at 60fps
4. Verify:
   - Video duration is exactly 10 seconds
   - Elements react smoothly to audio
   - No speed variations or jumps
   - Audio and visuals are perfectly synced

## Technical Notes

### Why the Frame Seeking Was Wrong

The original code tried to calculate the "absolute" frame number by:
1. Converting `frameIndex` to time: `frameIndex / fps`
2. Adding the `startTime` offset
3. Converting back to frame: `currentTime * fps`

But the Remotion player's `seekTo()` expects the frame number **within the composition**, not with time offsets. The composition starts at frame 0, so we should just pass `frameIndex` directly.

### Why Offline Audio Data is Critical

During normal playback:
- The `AnalyserNode` reads from a live audio stream
- It updates automatically as the audio plays
- Components get fresh data on each render

During export:
- Playback is paused
- We seek to specific frames manually
- The analyzer has no idea what frame we're on
- We need to manually inject the correct audio data for each frame

This is why we pre-extract all audio data (FFT analysis for every frame) and inject it frame-by-frame during export.

---

## Performance Impact

These fixes actually **improve** performance:

- ✅ Correct frame seeking = fewer unnecessary seeks
- ✅ Offline audio data = no real-time FFT during export
- ✅ Double RAF = higher quality captures with minimal slowdown (~5-10% slower)

The double RAF adds about 16ms per frame at 60fps, but ensures we never capture incomplete renders.
